### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Camilo AlarcÃ³n

I am a guy passionate about constantly learning about programming, my mission is to strive and always give my best to meet my goals and grow a lot.
Personally and professionally, I like to drink coffee while programming, I always try to deal with my difficulties as calmly as possible and break 
my problems down into different parts.

"Divide and conquer"; ðŸ’¯
